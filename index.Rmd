LandR is a collection of `SpaDES` modules [see @ChubatyMcIntire2019] aimed at
simulating forest dynamics across large spatial scales, while taking into
account various disturbances that affect them (e.g., wildfire and climate
change), as well as interactions with other components of forest systems, such
as bird communities and ungulates (via changes in the habitat of these species),
and carbon cycling.

The present manual is a "live" document, in that it grows and changes according to
the existing number of LandR modules, as well as their development. In addition,
"sub-manuals" may be produced describing particular collections of LandR modules
used for a simulation project or a group of similar modules -- e.g., a LandR 
Biomass manual would describe only the LandR modules that are essential for the
simulation of the vegetation components of forest succession, excluding 
disturbances or carbon cycling.

This manual does not cover the `SpaDES` toolkit, which we use to create and run
LandR modules. To learn more about `SpaDES` go to the [SpaDES
webpage](https://spades.predictiveecology.org/).
